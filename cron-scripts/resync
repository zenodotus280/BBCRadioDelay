# This is a script intended to be run weekly or bi-weekly, to restart the streams.
# It kills the stream and then reinitates it. The benefit of this is that the
# streams tend to get un-synchronized over time (in my experience, about 2 minutes per week)
# and by restarting them at least once a week we get everything back on track.

# NOTE: This script might require a bit of manual editing. ie, right now it is hard-coded for
# "radio2" and "radio4fm"

# Also note, the order of the killings is important. First, we kill the downloader. The downloader
# is responsible for restarting ffmpeg every time ffmpeg dies, so obviously we need to kill the
# downloader before killing ffmpeg.
